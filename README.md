# Taran's windots

Hello! Welcome to the showcase of my Windows dotfiles (windots) that I use daily. I prefer the clean and minimal type of desktops and have created this thus far.

### Minimal Version (with icons)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There was an issue with rendering any of the emoji/icons and a fix has now been made available. Turns out using `cat config.yaml | clip` is a very bad idea.

#### Current Features

- WM:
  - Subtle transparent glow underneath the bar
  - A blue glow around the active window (colour can be changed in config)
  - No titlebar -> thank you to [glazewm-extra :)](https://github.com/ptazithos/glazewm-extra)
- Bar:
  - Lightning emoji that when left clicked, displays Flow Launcher and changes the wallpaper on the right
  - A better date display (displayed as how you would read it)
  - Icons instead of text for each workspace
  - Current weather (long & lat must be changed to fit your current location!)
  - Border around the current time with an emoji to occupy it
  - "Not playing" emoji (in red) when no media is found to be playing
  - Distinct colour when music is played/paused
  - Better looking battery emoji placement
  - The GlazeWM current window tiling direction icon
  - Finally, a power-off button

## GlazeWM Version 3

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is using [GlazeWM's rewrite](https://github.com/glzr-io/glazewm) and not the previous build in C#.
> This includes a new bar too, [Zebar](https://github.com/glzr-io/zebar) - removes some functions I liked previously but it is what it is.
