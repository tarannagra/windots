# Taran's windots

Hello! Welcome to the showcase of my Windows dotfiles (windots) that I use daily. I prefer the clean and minimal type of desktops and have created this thus far.

# Important

I have another branch with content related to Komorebi instead of GlazeWM. You can find it by changing brances, or by [pressing me](https://github.com/tarannagra/windots/tree/komorebi)!

## 🪟 GlazeWM V3

Long awaited update of my current GlazeWM configuration.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is using [GlazeWM's rewrite](https://github.com/glzr-io/glazewm) and not the previous build in C#.
> This includes a new bar too, [Zebar](https://github.com/glzr-io/zebar) - removes some functions I liked previously but it is what it is.
